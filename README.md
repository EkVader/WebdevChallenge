HTML + CSS
Im learning Front-end dev and recently started to do so called "WebdevChallenges" from a particular FB group where there are a lot of them. This is the first one :)
This form isn't interactive but later i plan to make it usable.
Depending on browser it may take some time to fully load styles and images, try refreshing it after a minute or two.

In Chrome in the Send Email form for some reason textbox is bigger and doesn't fit in the container, i'll fix that.
