Im learning Front-end dev and recently started to do so called "WebdevChallenges" from a particular FB group where there are a lot of them. This is the first one :)
This form isn't interactive but later i plan to make it usable.

In Chrome in the Send Email form for some reason textbox is bigger and doesn't fit in the container, i'll fix that.

To display a page go to this link -> https://ekvader.github.io/WebdevChallenge/

To develop my CSS skills and show my progress im making those simple websites, nothing crazy pure HTML and CSS. Depending on browser it may take some time to fully load styles and images, try refreshing it after a minute or two.
